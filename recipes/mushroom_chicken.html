            </ul>

        </li>
        
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine chicken and all the marinade ingredients in a big bowl. Stir to mix well. Let marinate for 15 minutes while preparing the other ingredients.</li>
        <li>Combine all the sauce ingredients in a medium-sized bowl. Stir to mix well.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Spread the chicken in the skillet in a single layer. Sear until the bottom turns golden without moving it, 1 minute or so. Stir and flip to cook the other side, until turns golden, another minute or so. Transfer the cooked chicken pieces to a big plate and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and the mushrooms. Cook and stir until the mushrooms are cooked through and the liquid evaporated.</li>
        <li>Add the bamboo shoots, garlic, ginger, and onion. Drizzle with a bit more oil if the pan looks dry. Stir and cook for a minute.</li>
        <li>Stir the sauce again to thoroughly dissolve the cornstarch and pour it into the pan. Stir a few times until the sauce thickens.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken back into the skillet. Stir to coat everything well with the sauce. Immediately transfer everything to a big plate.</li>
        <li>Serve hot over steamed rice as a main dish.</li>
    </ol>
